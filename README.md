📊 Project 1: Course Rating Analysis
In this project, I explored the nuances of how courses are rated and the potential biases that affect these ratings. Key highlights include:

Identifying patterns in user behavior that influence course ratings.
Tackling issues like unequal sample sizes and outlier effects.
Implementing weighted average rating methods to improve fairness.
Visualizing insights through charts and graphs for a clearer understanding.
The goal was to ensure that course ratings better reflect the quality of the course and provide actionable insights for educators and learners alike.

🔍 Project 2: Course Sorting Optimization
This project focuses on creating smarter sorting algorithms for ranking courses, addressing flaws in traditional methods that rely solely on average ratings. Key features include:

Combining multiple criteria like user reviews, course popularity, and engagement levels.
Implementing sorting algorithms such as Bayesian Average Rating and hybrid models.
Evaluating the impact of sorting on user experience and decision-making.
Providing clear, data-driven methods for ranking courses more effectively.
The project emphasizes fairness and transparency in how courses are presented to learners, offering a better user experience for e-learning platforms.

These projects represent my passion for tackling real-world problems using Python and my interest in improving user experiences through data-driven insights. I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any suggestions for further improvements! 😊
